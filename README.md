## How To Run <a name="#howtorun"/>

Download the folder and open the index.html and you're good to go!<br>
You can read this on the game's page, but:<br>
Use the arrow keys or WASD and get to the other side! Each time you do it, it gets harder! Each time you get hit, it gets easier!

## Differences
 
So, what have I done differently? My games has:
- 4 rows of enemies and another order of tiles;
- Enemies speeds are multiplied by a winRate, so every time you win, they can accelerate even higher, and every time you get hit, that number decreases until it hits default;
- There's a number with how many times you got to the other side, minus the number you got hit 
- You can play with WASD!
